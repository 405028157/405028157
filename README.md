### My Interests:

- Shell scripts. I found https://tldp.org/guides.html helpful. 
- Soft router based on OpenWrt. [This is my practice](https://github.com/405028157/Notebook/blob/main/notes/openwrt.md). (Will be rewritted, including additional nas, docker topic, and clearer explanation of openwrt installation)
- FE knowledge. [FE-roadmap](https://github.com/thorseraq/FE-roadmap)
- I'm currently learning Rust through [Rust Offical Doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). I found [Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs/) helpful.
